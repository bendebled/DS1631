DS1631 library for Arduino

Save the contents of this repository into a folder
named DS1631 inside your Arduino/libraries directory.
If you don't have a libraries folder inside your 
Arduino sketchbook folder, go ahead and make one. 

This library contains function to talk to and read from
a DS1631 temperature sensor over I2C (Two-Wire) serial
interface.

The DS1631 is a digital thermometer with up to 12-bit
precision (0.0625 degrees C) that can sample continuously
or in one-shot mode, with a low-power idle state enabled
between readings in one-shot mode. It can read from -55
to +125 degrees Celsius.
